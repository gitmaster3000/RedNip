# RedNip
Project Rednip, as discussed earlier.

Starting first with the backend for location based clustering and then moving onto the front end.. Clustering can be on location, activity etc.

Also have to integrate group feature.


Purpose:
The main idea is not tinder but soemthing which helps "break the ice" in real-time soical situations however it maybe. It's not even about dating. Many people want to interact but can't due to social inhibitions. If they can acheive this through an app/tech that's awesome!

So the focus is solely on that for individuals, groups or visitors to help them break the ice with other when/if they want. What can help?

letting them find people who also wanna do the same at that exact moment.
Matching based on iterestes.. 
ice breker questions/fixed intro questions can be sent or gifs...
Using some AR to show who's interested in meeting up? (future work)


Use Case:
Guy stands in a bar, looking for girls and vice versa.

Tourist looking for locals to hangout with.

Friends looking for chatign up new people at a concert.

Girl goes shopping and wants to pair up with another girl.

Main reason people cant' break ice when they want to is:

distrust and 
not knowing what to say
Afraid that other's mgith not want to interact.

we can solve all of these.

Even if the idea doesn't lift off it's an awesome experiment which can and must be tried. No social app is basically realtime and doesn'\t blend well with realworld interactions. Social media app interactions are completely isolated and occour on screens and phones detached from reality. That can be cahnged.
